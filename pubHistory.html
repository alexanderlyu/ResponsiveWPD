        Iron Man was created by writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber, alongside
        artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Iron Man originally appeared in
        Tales of Suspense #39 which released in March 1963. Early Iron Man comics
        and storylines explored Cold War themes as well as entrepreneurship, government
        oversight and individuality. Modern storylines continue to include technological
        advancement and national defense.

        <p>I think I gave myself a dare. It was the height of the Cold War. The readers, the young readers, 
            if there was one thing they hated, it was war, it was the military. So I got a hero who represented 
            that to the hundredth degree. He was a weapons manufacturer, he was providing weapons for the Army, 
            he was rich, he was an industrialist. I thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that 
            nobody would like, none of our readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them 
            like him ... And he became very popular.</p>
